# Expense Tracker
Objective
The objective of this project is to create an expense tracker application that helps users manage their finances effectively. It will allow users to track their expenses, view their total expenses and balance, set a budget, add new transactions, delete transactions, and even undo transactions.

Features
Total Expenses and Balance: Display the total expenses and current balance at a glance. This gives users a quick overview of their financial situation.

Budget Management: Allow users to set a budget for a specific time frame (e.g., monthly, weekly) and track their spending against the budget.

Add New Transaction: Users can add new expenses or income transactions by providing a category, amount, date, and optional notes.

Delete Transaction: Provide the ability to delete a transaction if it was added in error or is no longer relevant.

Undo Transaction: Implement an undo feature that allows users to revert the last transaction. This feature helps users correct mistakes easily.
